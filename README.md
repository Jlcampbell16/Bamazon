# Bamazon

**Overview:**
    In this Amazon-like storefront, you can select the product and number of units you'd like to purchase, and the app will check the current inventory in the database before calculating your total. If there are not enough units of the item you selected in-stock, you will receive an insufficient quantity notice.

    -Please note, naturally the app will allow you to make another purchase after your first purchase or if you have received the insufficient quantity notice. To keep the video clean and easy to read, I have turned that feature off and reset the screen each time. 

**Technology Used:**
    Node.js
    MySQL
